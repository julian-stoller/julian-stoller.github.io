# Big Red Hacks 2025

In September of 2025 I decided to participate in Big Red Hacks, a hackathon taking place on campus from 09/19 to 09/21. Given that I'm a MechE and hackathons are more of a software developement thing, I didn't expect to perform well. I simply just wanted to participate in an in-person Hackathon before graduating.

The theme was Entertainment, so I designed what I called in my presentation a 'Customized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendama">Kendama</a> w/AM, Parametric CAD, and Interchangable Parts'. 
My question was, how can I add value to a rather simple toy (a kendama) by strategically applying design principals that I hold in high regard? 

**Interchangable Parts:**
  - A kendama with interchangable parts could grow with a user as they go from a begineer to an expert.
    - A beginner might want to replace the 'cup' of the kendama with larger ones to make the initial stages of learning to use the kendama easier.
      - Similar things could be said about the kendama's string. 
    - An expert might want to make using a kendama really hard, so they might find value in the ability to make the cups of an existing kendama small to the point of inconvenience in use. 
      - All features of the kendama (handle length, weight distribution, cup diameter, cup shape, etc) can be altered in some way to make a kendama more unwieldly.
    - This object having interchangable parts would make people able to customize their kendamas by replacing select parts with parts of a different color or with different branding if desired.


**3D Printed:**
  - Designing this kendama (or set of kendamas, meta-kendama?) would allow anyone with access to a 3D printer access to a kendama. 
  - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_for_manufacturability">D.F.M.</a> with 3D printing is generally not difficult to do, that being said when it's done poorly the overall quality of your part/product plummits. By designing the individual parts of my project to be difficult to print wrong, my project's overall quality (and how well it mirror's the quality of a typical wooden kendama) would grow. This is especially important if I am anticipating possible users might not be technically inclined enough to modify the default slicer settings for the printer they have access to.
  - Making a design 3D printable (and what often comes with that, which is open accessibility of part geometries on websites such as <a href="https://thingiverse.com">Thingiverse</a>) allows for the user-in-the-loop part revision, furthering the aforementioned goal of allowing a greater level of customization.

**Parametric CAD:**
  - Implementing, and then making widely accessible, an easy to edit CAD file would allow for the aforementioned anticipated use cases to be more widely realized, specifically by an audience that might otherwise be put-off by the need to learn CAD in order to customize a part.
  - By designing the CAD file itself such that the parameters relevant in editing things like cup diameter and handle length are immediately visible, I would be lowering the bar for how technically inclined one might need to be in order to customize their kendama. 

Having all of this in mind, I started work on a basic implementation of what I've outlined above. 

A kendama that 3D printable, designed with interchangable parts when relevant, and with relevant dimentions very easily customizable in software.

  <p>Once I got the CAD done I displayed and in a way pitched my project to the judges of the competitions:</p>

  <p>Afterwards I was nominated as one of the five finalist teams, which meant I would be displaying my project to a larger audience:</p>

  <p>I ended up winner the Hardware Track, recognizing hardware use and technical implementation, for which I was given 2 24" Sceptre Curved Monitors.</p>
