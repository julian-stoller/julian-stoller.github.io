# Big Red Hacks 2025

In September of 2025 I decided to participate in Big Red Hacks, a hackathon taking place on campus from 09/19 to 09/21. Given that I'm a MechE and hackathons are more of a software developement thing, I didn't expect to perform well. I simply just wanted to participate in an in-person Hackathon before graduating.

The theme was Entertainment, so I designed what I called in my presentation a 'Customized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendama">Kendama</a> w/AM, Parametric CAD, and Interchangable Parts'. 
My question was, how can I add value to a rather simple toy (a kendama) by strategically applying design principals that I hold in high regard? 

- Interchangable Parts:
  - A kendama with interchangable parts could grow with a user

- 3D Printed:

- Parametric CAD:

I entered as a one man team and won the hardware track acknowleding use of hardware and technical implementation, and was one of five finalist teams.
