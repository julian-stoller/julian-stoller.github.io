# Big Red Hacks 2025

In September of 2025 I decided to participate in Big Red Hacks, a hackathon taking place on campus from 09/19 to 09/21. Given that I'm a MechE and hackathons are more of a software developement thing, I didn't expect to perform well. I simply just wanted to participate in an in-person Hackathon before graduating.

The theme was Entertainment, so I designed what I called in my presentation a 'Customized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendama">Kendama</a> w/AM, Parametric CAD, and Interchangable Parts'. 
My question was, how can I add value to a rather simple toy (a kendama) by strategically applying design principals that I hold in high regard? 

**Interchangable Parts:**
  - A kendama with interchangable parts could grow with a user as they go from a begineer to an expert.
    - A beginner might want to replace the 'cup' of the kendama with larger ones to make the initial stages of learning to use the kendama easier.
      - Similar things could be said about the kendama's string. 
    - An expert might want to make using a kendama really hard, so they might find value in the ability to make the cups of an existing kendama small to the point of inconvenience in use. 
      - All features of the kendama (handle length, weight distribution, cup diameter, cup shape, etc) can be altered in some way to make a kendama more unwieldly.
    - This object having interchangable parts would make people able to customize their kendamas by replacing select parts with parts of a different color or with different branding if desired.


**3D Printed:**
  - Designing this kendama (or set of kendamas, meta-kendama?) would allow anyone with access to a 3D printer access to a kendama.

**Parametric CAD:**
  - Implementing, and then making widely accessible, an easy to edit CAD file would allow for the aforementioned anticipated use cases to be

I entered as a one man team and won the hardware track acknowleding use of hardware and technical implementation, and was one of five finalist teams.
